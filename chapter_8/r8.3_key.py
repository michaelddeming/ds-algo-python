"""Give a justification of Proposition 8.4."""

# Proposition 8.4: The height of a nonempty tree T is equal to the maximum of the depths of its lea positions.

# Height of a "root" node is defined as the recursive height of its children + 1. Similar to depth being 0 starting from the "root" node, by finding the max depth the tree's leaves, this will also resemble the height.
