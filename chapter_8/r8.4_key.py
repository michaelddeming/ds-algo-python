"""What is the running time of a call to T._height2(p) when called on a position p distinct from the root of T? (See Code Fragment 8.5.)"""

# The running time of a call to T._height(p) when called on a position p distince from the root of T is O(n) in the worst-case. Where n is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at position p.
