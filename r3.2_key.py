"""The number of operations executed by algorithms A and B is 8nlogn and
2n^2, respectively. Determine n_0 such that A is better than B for n â‰¥ n0."""

A = "8nlogn"
B = "2n^2"

"You can solve this problem by graphing both time complexities as functions equal to f(n). As n increases along the x-axis, the inflection point or 'crossing-over' between these graphs determine the n value where the the B funtion or time comlpexity becomes less efficient than that of A. These graph inflect at n = 16. Meaning that the minimum number of operations need to be executed in order for algo A to become more efficient that algo B."
