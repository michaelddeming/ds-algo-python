"""Show that n^2 is Î©(nlogn)."""

# f(n) >= c_1 * g(n)

# n^2 >= c_1 * nlog(n)

# divide by n

# n >= c_1 * log(n)

# divide log(n) on both sides

#  n/(log(n)) >= c_1 

# plug-in values that are valid for the def of Big Omega to try and prove this inequality true. Use n = e and c_1 = 1.

# e/(log(e)) >= 1

# ~2.18/1 >= 1 --> True
