"""Show that if d(n) is O(f(n)), then ad(n) is O(f(n)), for any constant
a > 0."""


# d(n) <= c * f(n)
  
# a * d(n) <= a * c * f(n)

# a * d(n) <= ac * f(n)

# If d(n) is represented as having a similar time complexity to that of f(n). Multiplying "a" to d(n) only impacts the constant, c, value. This would slightly skew our graph/function, but remain with an overall time complexity of O(f(n)).
