# create a stack

# iterate over every character in the expression provided. 

# if a character is in the "lefty" string group, append or push the character to the stack. 

# if the character is in the "right" string group, 
    # check if the stack is empty (no matching "lefty" character previously found.
    # check if the index value of the charcter in "righty" group is the same index value of the "lefty" group of S.pop().
