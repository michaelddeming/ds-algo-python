"""Consider what happens if the loop in the ArrayQueue. resize method at
lines 53-55 of Code Fragment 6.7 had been implemented as: for k in range(self. size): self. data[k] = old[k] # rather than old[walk]
Give a clear explanation of what could go wrong."""

# if were bypass "walk", which houses the front of the "old" queue, we would not accurately capture the "front" values associated in our "old" queue when trying to update the new self._data starting at a Q._front = 0.

# By bypassing walk and directly using old[k], you would incorrectly assume that the elements in the old array are stored in sequential order starting at index 0. This assumption would lead to a misalignment of elements in the new array (self._data), resulting in a corrupted queue where the logical order of elements is lost.
