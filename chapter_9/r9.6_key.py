"""Can you adapt your solution to the previous problem to make remove min run in O(1) time for the UnsortedPriorityQueue class? Explain your answer."""

#  To adapt the solution so that remove_min() runs in  O(1)  time, we can introduce an auxiliary structure to track the elements in sorted order. While elements in the main queue remain unsorted, this additional structure will maintain references to the elements in sorted order (either by directly storing the elements or their indices).
